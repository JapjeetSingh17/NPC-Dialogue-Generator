# Speech-to-Speech RPG Demo ⚔️🎙️

A browser-based RPG experiment that integrates Generative AI to create immersive, voice-driven NPC interactions. Explore the town of Brightwood and help the local guard using your real voice.

## 🌟 Features

* **Speech-to-Speech Interaction:** No typing required. Speak to the NPC using the Web Speech API, and receive audio responses generated by Gemini TTS.
* **Context-Aware AI:** The NPC (Marcus) is powered by `gemini-2.5-flash-preview`. He remembers the game state, reacts to your specific phrasing, and guides you through the quest dynamically.
* **Dynamic Quest System:** A state-managed quest ("The Lost Sword") that tracks whether the player has accepted the task, found the item, or completed the objective.
* **2D Physics World:** Built with Phaser 3, featuring collision detection, zone triggers, and top-down movement.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Game Engine:** [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/)
* **AI & TTS:** Google Gemini API (v1beta)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Speech Recognition:** Native Web Speech API

## 🗺️ The World

The game takes place in **Brightwood**, featuring locations such as the Town Square, Docks, and a Soccer Field where the quest item is hidden.

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git)
    ```

2.  **Add your API Key:**
    Open `Npc.html` and locate the `apiKey` variable. Replace the placeholder with your valid Google Gemini API key.
    ```javascript
    const apiKey = "YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_KEY";
    ```

3.  **Run a Local Server:**
    Because this project uses ES Modules (`<script type="module">`) and loads local assets, you cannot simply open the HTML file in a browser. You must use a local server.
    * **VS Code:** Install the "Live Server" extension, right-click `Npc.html`, and select "Open with Live Server."
    * **Python:** Run `python -m http.server` in the directory and navigate to `localhost:8000`.

## 🎮 Controls

* **Movement:** Arrow Keys or WASD.
* **Interact:** Walk into the "Talk Zone" (near the red NPC) until the UI updates.
* **Talk:** Click and hold the **"Hold to Talk"** button (or touch on mobile) to speak into your microphone.

## 📂 Assets
* **Map:** `img.jpg` (Fantasy Town Map).
* **Code:** Single-file logic contained in `Npc.html`.

*Note: This project requires a browser that supports the Web Speech API (e.g., Google Chrome).*
